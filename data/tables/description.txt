This application displays two side-by-side panels of drought indices and/or climate variables over the Contiguous United States for comparison. For each panel, you may select an index or variable from the list below this description. Data was acquired from the [WestWide Drought Tracker](https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/current.php?folder=spi3&region=ww) of the Desert Research Institue, [NOAA's Physical Sciences Division](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/products/monitor/), and the [PRISM Climate Group](http://prism.nacse.org/).

For each panel, you may select a function to apply to the index, adjust the time period over which the function is calculated, change the base map, and change the colorscale.  Each point in the map represents a 0.25 by 0.25 decimal degree grid cell. Hovering over these points shows the index value, county, and specific grid cell ID of each location. Hovering over the map and scrolling allows you to zoom and search the base map for a particular location. Clicking and dragging the mouse allows you to pan the map. Holding control, clicking, and dragging the mouse allows you to change the viewing aspect. You may also generate a time series of monthly values as a bar chart for any particular location by clicking on a point in the map, selecting a specific county, selecting a specific state, or uploading a shapefile. Hovering over the bar chart shows the date and index value for individual months within the time period selected.
