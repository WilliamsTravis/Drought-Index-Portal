# This is an attempt to automate the process of setting up a computer to run a DASH app.
# To make this file work do this:

# 1) Add "export PATH=$PATH:/root/<repository-name>/scriptfile or .bash_profile
# 2) Make this file executable using "chmod u+x setup.sh"
# 3) Ideally, run the line "./setup.sh" and wait!

# Things to do:

# 1) Turn paths into variables. Use this site:
	# "https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-and-use-bash-scripts/"
# 2) Plenty more I'm sure...
